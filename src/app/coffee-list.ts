    { name: 'Jacobs', story: ['The story of Jacobs Coffee begins in 1895 when Johann Jacobs opened his first grocery at age 26. It was a specialty shop for coffee, tea, cocoa, chocolate and biscuits in the center of Bremen, Germany. The store was established with Jacobs underlying promise, "I will make it my challenge to only deliver the best and flawless goods, always at a reasonable price."', 
            'Johann had spent several years learning the coffee trade as a retailer in one of Bremens trading establishments. Even while still an apprentice, Jacobs was chosen to roast and taste the coffee samples because of his exceptional sense of taste. Jacobs shop became the foundation of a company that grew to operate on an international scale. In 1907, Jacobs started his own roasting plant and began supplying the area around Bremen with roast coffee. In 1929, Johanns nephew, Walther J. Jacobs, returned to Bremen to join his uncle’s business.',
            'The brand identity emerged to include the colors of yellow and black and the famous slogan ‘Jacobs Kaffee Wunderbar’. Walther implemented many new marketing and distribution ideas. As demand grew for Jacobs Kaffee, the company expanded but never compromised the quality of its products. Today, Jacobs is a leading premium coffee brand with its core product Krönung ("coronation" in German) known throughout Europe for its “pampering aroma,” or "verwöhnaroma" in German. Jacobs is the best-selling dry grocery brand in Germany and is among the most popular coffee brands in Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Switzerland.',

    { name: 'Douwe Egberts', story: [ 'Jacobs Douwe Egberts is a Dutch privately owned company that owns numerous beverage brands (coffee, tea and hot chocolate). It was formed in 2015 following the merger of the coffee division of Mondelez International with Douwe Egberts.The company is majority owned by Acorn Holdings, a subsidiary of JAB Holding Company. Mondelez International owns the remaining shares.',
            'BEGINNINGS: The company has its origins in De Witte Os, a general grocery shop that Egbert Douwes established in 1753 in Joure, Netherlands. In 1780, the company was transferred to his eldest son Douwe Egberts. It developed into a company dealing in coffee, tea, and tobacco. By 1925 it had changed its name to Douwe Egberts (as in Douwe, the son of Egbert), and had introduced the red seal as its logo.', 
            'INTERNATIONAL EXPANSIONS: In 1948, the company began to sell its products in Belgium, followed by France, Spain and Denmark. It founded a new holding company, Douwe Egberts Koninklijke ("Royal Douwe Egberts") in 1968, and a year later took over the Dutch coffee manufacturer Kanis & Gunnink. The company expanded through Europe, acquiring other tea, coffee and tobacco companies, such as the UK tea distributor Hornimans Tea.', 
            'SARA LEE: In 1978 Douwe Egberts was taken over by Consolidated Foods Corporation, later the Sara Lee Corporation. In 1989, Douwe Egberts purchased Van Nelle, its main Dutch competitor in coffee, tea and tobacco. It sold its tobacco interests, including Van Nelle and Drum rolling tobacco, to Imperial Tobacco in 1998. In 2001, the company collaborated with Philips to produce the Senseo coffee maker. The following year it established the Douwe Egberts Foundation, an independent entity that initiates and manages coffee and tea projects in countries of origin. Douwe Egberts sued the province of Groningen in 2007 over the introduction of rules stating that all coffee supplied in the province must meet Fair trade criteria set by Stichting Max Havelaar. Courts ruled in favour of the province of Groningen. With profits from the coffee division under threat from rivals such as Nestlé and Kraft, and being unable to find a buyer, in 2012 Sara Lee split off the coffee division into D.E Master Blenders 1753, offering share-holders one share in the new company for each main share they held. The main Sara Lee company changed its name to Hillshire Brands.',

    { name: 'Illy', story: ['Francesco Illy founded illycaffè in 1933.  His 1935 invention of the illetta, considered the blueprint for modern espresso machines, revolutionized coffee preparation.  His innovative method of packaging, based on pressurization, enabled illy’s initial exports to Sweden and Holland during the 1940s. Francesco Illy’s method remains the standard for preserving and enhancing coffee’s freshness during transport and storage. Ernesto, Francesco’s son, earned a doctorate in chemistry and joined the company in the late 1940s.  His passion for learning gave rise to illy’s formal scientific and technological research efforts, starting with an-house laboratory dedicated to coffee chemistry.  In the 1950s, he spear-headed the company expansion into homes, selling smaller cans of ground coffee for the first time. In 1965 he moved the company to its current Via Flavia headquarters, still in Trieste. In 1974, Dr. Illy furthered the company’s lead in coffee innovation with ESE, the first pre-measured espresso pods, making café-quality espresso simple and easy at home or the bar.  In 1988, he introduced and patented a photo-chromatic means to identify the highest quality beans, one by one, right at the source. The 1990s saw the creation of the illy Art Collection, a new logo by renowned pop-artist James Rosenquist, and establishment of the Brazil Award recognizing excellence in coffee cultivation.
